CHOICE POINT #1: JA
Option Chosen: [A]
Explanation: The reason why I chose option A is because I feel like that our school has very little school spirit. And I thought that for a Ja website might as well go with the Ja colors. and also I did not really feel like going to a color picker and picking out color values that I like to put into the code.

REFLECTION


What I Learned:
[Write 5-8 sentences reflecting on Module 1:
What I have learned from this module is that its pretty easy to use bootdstrap as all you need to do is link boot strap to the page and you are able to use the styling of boot strap on your website. This makes it simple and easy to style your website. the most challenging part of this module is going to be setting up the file to work and it took me some tome to figure out what I was doing wrong in the terminal. I feel like its okay for my css as i just want this assignment to be over with. Will I use Jagtrack? most likly not as have have other resources I use that are better and easier to use and keep track of my school work.
